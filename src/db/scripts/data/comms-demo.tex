\subsection*{Problem Statement}

This is a sample communication task without a custom checker, using only the built-in diff checker.

The task is to compute the sum of the first N numbers. Make sure you flush after every output. The communicator will wait for your output before giving the next number.

\subsection*{Input Format}

The first line of input contains an integer \(T\), the number test cases.

Each of the next \(T\) lines contains an integer \(n\).

\subsection*{Output Format}

Output \(T\) lines, each containing the sum of the first \(n\) numbers.
